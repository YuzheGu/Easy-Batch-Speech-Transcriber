@Situation:
SP1:	in another moment, down went alice after it, never once, considering how in the world she was to get out again.
SP2:	the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then div suddenly down. so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
SP1:	either the wall was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.
SP2:	first, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything. then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves. here and there. she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
SP1:	she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed, it was labeled orange marmalade, but to her great disappointment, it was empty. she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody. so managed to put it onto one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
